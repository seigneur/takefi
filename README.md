# Takefi - Bitcoin Cross-Chain Oracle for RWA Token Swaps

## Overview

This project implements a trustless cross-chain swap mechanism that allows users to exchange Bitcoin (BTC) for Real-World Asset (RWA) tokens on Ethereum while keeping their BTC native on the Bitcoin blockchain. The system uses Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs), Chainlink oracles, and market maker liquidity to create secure, atomic swaps without requiring wrapped tokens or custodial solutions.

    participant U as User
    participant O as Oracle
    participant MM as Market Maker
    participant BTC as Bitcoin Network
    participant ETH as Ethereum Network

    U->>O: Request swap quote
    O->>MM: Get liquidity offers
    MM->>O: Return swap rates
    O->>U: Display available offers
    
    U->>O: Confirm swap selection
    O->>O: Generate secure preimage
    O->>BTC: Create HTLC script
    U->>BTC: Lock BTC in HTLC
    
    O->>ETH: Verify BTC lock
    O->>ETH: Release RWA tokens to user
    O->>MM: Provide preimage
    MM->>BTC: Claim BTC using preimage
```


The system consists of three main actors working together:

### üßë‚Äçüíª **User**
- Holds Bitcoin and wants to swap for RWA tokens (e.g., XCOINB)
- Locks BTC in a Bitcoin script with timelock protection
- Receives RWA tokens on Ethereum upon successful swap

### üè¶ **Market Maker (MM)**
- Provides liquidity for both BTC and RWA tokens
- Pre-funds the system to enable instant swaps
- Earns fees from successful transactions
- Takes on inventory and market risk

### üîÆ **Oracle (Chainlink)**
- Generates secure preimages for HTLC scripts
- Monitors both Bitcoin and Ethereum networks
- Triggers atomic swap execution when conditions are met
- Stores sensitive data securely in AWS Secrets Manager

## üîê Security Features

### **Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs)**
- Bitcoin scripts that require a secret (preimage) to unlock
- Built-in timelock protection prevents funds from being permanently locked
- Atomic execution ensures both sides of the swap complete or neither does

### **Oracle-Generated Preimages**
- Cryptographically secure random preimage generation
- Stored encrypted in AWS Secrets Manager
- Released only when swap conditions are verified on-chain

### **Market Maker Bonds**
- MMs post collateral to guarantee swap execution
- Economic incentives prevent malicious behavior
- Slashing mechanisms for failed deliveries

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### **Backend Oracle**
- **Node.js + Express**: RESTful API server
- **bitcoinjs-lib**: Bitcoin script generation and transaction handling
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Secure preimage storage and retrieval
- **Chainlink Functions**: Cross-chain verification and automation

### **Frontend Interface**
- **React + Tailwind CSS**: Modern, responsive user interface
- **Real-time updates**: Live swap progress tracking
- **Market maker aggregation**: Compare offers from multiple liquidity providers

### **Smart Contracts**
- **Ethereum/Solidity**: RWA token management and escrow
- **Chainlink integration**: Oracle data feeds and automation
- **Multi-signature security**: Protected fund management
